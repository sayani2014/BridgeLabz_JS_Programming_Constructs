## Sequence Practice Problems
1. Use REPL to get Single Digit.
2. Use REPL – Use Random to get Dice Number between 1 to 6
3. Use REPL – Add two Random Dice Number and Print the Result
4. Use Script & Debug – Write a program that reads 5 Random 2 Digit values , then find their sum and the average
5. Use Script & Debug – Unit Conversion
    - 1ft = 12 in then 42 in = ? ft
    - Rectangular Plot of 60 feet x 40 feet in meters
    - Calculate area of 25 such plots in acres

## Selection Practice Problems with if & else
1. Write a program that reads 5 Random 3 Digit values and then outputs the minimum and the maximum value
2. Write a program that takes day and month from the command line and prints true if day of month is between March 20 and June 20, false otherwise.
3. Write a program that takes a year as input and outputs the Year is a Leap Year or not a Leap Year. 
4. Write a program to simulate a coin flip and print out "Heads" or "Tails" accordingly.

## Selection Practice Problems with if else if and else
1. Read a single digit number and write the number in word
2. Read a Number and Display the week day (Sunday, Monday,...)
3. Read a Number 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc and display unit, ten, hundred,...
4. Enter 3 Numbers do following arithmetic operation and find the one that is maximum and minimum
      1. a + b * c 
      2. a % b + c 
      3. c + a / b
      4. a * b + c

## Selection Practice Problems with case statements
1. Read a single digit number and write the number in word using Case
2. Read a Number and Display the week day (Sunday, Monday,...)
3. Read a Number 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc and display unit, ten, hundred,...
4. Write a program that takes User Inputs and does Unit Conversion of different Length units
      1. Feet to Inch 
      2. Feet to Meter
      3. Inch to Feet
      4. Meter to Feet

## Repetition Practice Problems with for loop
1. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n.
2. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints the nth harmonic number.
3. Write a program that takes a input and determines if the number is a prime.
4. Extend the program to take a range of number as input and output the Prime Numbers in that range.
5. Write a program that computes a factorial of a number taken as input.
6. Write a program to compute Factors of a number N using prime factorization method.
    - Logic -> Traverse till i*i <= N instead of i <= N for efficiency.
    - O/P -> Print the prime factors of number N.

## Repetition Practice Problems with while loop
1. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n till 256 is reached.
2. Find the Magic Number
    a. Ask the user to think of a number n between 1 to 100
    b. Then check with the user if the number is less then n/2 or greater
    c. Repeat till the Magic Number is reached
3. Extend the Flip Coin problem till either Heads or Tails wins 11 times.
4. Write a Program where a gambler starts with Rs 100 and places Re 1 bet until he/she goes broke i.e. no more money to gamble or reaches the goal of Rs 200. Keeps track of number of times won and number of bets made.

## Functions Practice Problems
1. Help user find degF or degC based on their Conversion Selection. Use Case Statement and ensure that the inputs are within the Freezing Point ( 0 °C / 32 °F ) and the Boiling Point of Water ( 100 °C / 212 °F )
      a. degF = (degC * 9/5) + 32
      b. degC = (degF – 32) * 5/9
2. Write a function to check if the two numbers are Palindromes
3. Take a number from user and check if the number is a Prime then show that its palindrome is also prime
      a. Write function check if number is Prime
      b. Write function to get the Palindrome.
      c. Check if the Palindrome number is also prime
